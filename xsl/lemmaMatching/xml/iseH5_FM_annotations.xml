         mentioned was the newly-built Globe, as represented memorably in Olivier's film adaptation.
         But Tiffany Stern argues convincingly from both internal and external evidence that

         the "crooked figure" as the round zero, but the implication is that the actor, or even
         Henry himself, is the "figure," with "crooked" suggesting possible overtones of craftiness
         and deception; compare Canterbury's disdain for the French "crooked titles" (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-241">TLN 241</ref>), and cf. <hi rend="simple:italic">WT</hi>

               <term>flood</term>
               <note type="level-2">Canterbury's metaphor for Henry's "reformation" recalls two biblical floods at
         once, both common to the rhetoric of sixteenth-century religious polemic. On the one hand
         it recalls the image of the Genesis deluge -- the first godly reform --that cleansed the
         false religion that held sway in Noah's sinful world. Calvin, in Arthur Golding's 1583
         translation of his sermons on Deuteronomy, had evoked that flood in language that
         Shakespeare may imitate here:<cit>
                     <quote>the seruice of GOD was imbaced euen in the life of
            Adam, and that it was fayne to bee reformed againe as it were by miracle. When the
            floude came, God cleansed the earth newe againe. (1129)</quote>
                  </cit> But the phrase also
         has a potentially negative religious connotation for Shakespeare's audience, and it is
         telling that the current that scours away Prince Hal's faults is "heady" -- threatening,
         disorderly, uncontrollable -- a word the play applies only once (in the F2 reading)
         elsewhere: to the "murder, spoil, and villainy" with which Henry threatens the defeated
         Harfleur (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-1291">TLN 1291</ref>). This second
         connotation of <hi rend="simple:italic">flood</hi>, along with Canterbury's mention of "hydra-headed willfulness"
         immediately following, suggests instead an allusion to the flood that proceeds from the
         mouth of the many-headed dragon of Revelation: "And ye serpe[n]t cast out of his mouth
         water after ye woman like a flood, yt he might cause her to be caryed away of the flood"
         (Revelation 12:15). Traditionally read as an allegory of the Arian heresy that threatened
         the early Church, the dragon-flood metaphor was activated by both early-modern reformers
         and Catholics to describe the Satanically-inspired waves of heresy that each confession saw
         flowing from the other.</note>

         to the biographers of Alexander the great, it could only be untied by the destined ruler of
         Asia; in 333 BCE Alexander cut the knot with his sword, an act that became a metaphor for
         an intractable problem solved by bold thinking (see Tilley G375). This is first of several

            king even at first appointing with himselfe, to shew that in his person princelie honors

            whereas aforetime he had made himselfe a companion unto misrulie mates of dissolute
            order and life, he now banished them all from his presence (but not unrewarded, or else
            unpreferred) inhibiting them upon a great paine, not once to approach, lodge, or
            sojourne within ten miles of his court or presence: and in their places he chose men of
            gravitie, wit, and high policie. (Holinshed 543)</quote>

         speaks no lines in this scene, and does not appear in the scene's analog in Q. His brother
         Clarence speaks no line in the entire play, and is only mentioned twice, appearing in this
         stage direction and addressed once (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-3072">TLN

         lines to Clarence, argues (in <hi rend="simple:italic">Three Studies</hi>, 101) that Q indicates an authoritative
         intention to streamlines these characters. The appearance of all four royal brothers,
         however, is symbolically fitting; as Gurr argues, retaining them all in this scene
         underscores the play's emphasis on brotherhood. Historically, Thomas, Duke of Clarence
            (<hi rend="simple:italic">c</hi>. 1388-1421), was part of the 1415 French campaign until he was invalided home

               <note type="level-2">The <hi rend="simple:italic">Pactus Legis Salicae</hi> was a legal code that adapted Roman law for the
         governance of the barbarian tribes under Frankish rule. Issued by the Frankish King Clovis
         I between 508 and 511, the <hi rend="simple:italic">Pactus</hi> governed crime as well as inheritance, but when
         later French jurists used it to combat English claims of inheritance, it came to be
         synonymous with the tenet of agnatic succession, i.e., the exclusion of females from the
         inheritance of titles in "Salic" land, a phrase that, as Canterbury points out, has no
         certain interpretation. See Patrick Geary, <hi rend="simple:italic">Before France and Germany</hi> (Oxford: Oxford
         UP, 1988), 90-91 and 105-106. An Elizabethan audience would be well aware of the
         obsolescence of any such laws in Tudor England, but they would also be familiar with the
         Salic Law from its prominence in public discourse about the queen's proposed marriage to
         the Duke of Alen√ßon in the 1570s. In 1579, the puritan John Stubbes wrote "The Discoverie
         of a Gaping Gulf," an immediately censored, but much-read pamphlet against the marriage
         that suggested that Salic Law would strip Elizabeth of her power should she marry a
         Frenchman.</note>

               <gloss>1) Legal entitlement; 2) justice, moral propriety.</gloss>
               <note type="level-2">In this scene, Henry precisely and strategically calculates his rhetoric to
         collapse two not quite identical senses of <hi rend="simple:italic">right</hi>. Here, he seems to use the word in
         its legal sense (<hi rend="simple:italic">OED </hi>II.): he will have the legal "right" to claim the titles,
         presuming they are not "miscreate." In this sense, <hi rend="simple:italic">right</hi> is merely a synonym of
            <hi rend="simple:italic">title</hi> or <hi rend="simple:italic">claim</hi>, and one might conceivably claim a legal right that was
         derived falsely, i.e., "suiting not with the truth." This is the sense Canterbury employs
         consistently in the scene: "right and title of the female" (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-236">TLN 236</ref>); "with blood and sword and fire to win your right"
            (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-278">TLN 278</ref>). Henry, however, subtly
         alters the meaning of the word when he next uses it: "May I with right and conscience make
         this claim?" (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-243">TLN 243</ref>). The pairing of
            "right"<hi rend="simple:italic"> </hi>with "conscience"<hi rend="simple:italic"> </hi>suggests their equivalency, that the moral sense
         of <hi rend="simple:italic">right </hi>(<hi rend="simple:italic">OED </hi>I.) is now in play. This retroactively renders Henry's
         injunction at <ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-163">TLN 163</ref> absurd: if the
         titles are right in the moral sense, then they are also, already, true. The dual senses
         form a pivot around which the archbishop, and Henry himself, can turn the legal argument.

               <note type="level-2">Other than Shakespeare's versification of Canterbury's speech, it is nearly
         verbatim from Holinshed (545-546): <cit>
                     <quote>Herein did he much inueie against the
            surmised and false fained law Salike, which the Frenchmen alledge euer against the kings
            of England in barre of their iust title to the crowne of France. The verie words of that
            supposed law are these, In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant, that is to saie, Into
            the Salike land let not women succeed. Which the French glossers expound to be the
            realme of France, and that this law was made by king Pharamond; whereas yet their owne
            authors affirme, that the land Salike is in Germanie, betweene the riuers of Elbe and
            Sala; and that when Charles the great had ouercome the Saxons, he placed there certeine
            Frenchmen, which hauing in disdeine the dishonest manners of the Germane women, made a
            law, that the females should not succeed to any inheritance within that land, which at
            this daie is called Meisen, so that if this be true, this law was not made for the
            realme of France, nor the Frenchmen possessed the land Salike, till foure hundred and
            one and twentie yeares after the death of Pharamond, the supposed maker of this Salike
            law, for this Pharamond deceased in the yeare 426, and Charles the great subdued the
            Saxons; and placed the Frenchmen in those parts beyond the riuer of Sala, in the yeare
            805. Moreouer, it appeareth by their owne writers, that king Pepine, which deposed
            Childerike, claimed the crowne of France, as heire generall, for that he was descended
            of Blithild daughter to king Clothair the first: Hugh Capet also, who vsurped the crowne
            upon Charles duke of Loraine, the sole heire male of the line and stocke of Charles the
            great, to make his title seem true, and appeare good, though in deed it was starke
            naught, conueied himselfe as heire to the ladie Lingard, daughter to king Charlemaine,
            sonne to Lewes the emperour, that was son to Charles the great. King Lewes also the
            tenth otherwise called saint Lewes, being verie heire to the said vsurper Hugh Capet,
            could neuer be satisfied in his conscience how he might iustlie keepe and possesse the
            crowne of France, till he was persuaded and fullie instructed, that queene Isabell his
            grandmother was lineallie descended of the ladie Ermengard daughter and heire to the
            aboue named duke of Loraine, by the which marriage, the bloud and line of Charles the
            great was againe vnited and restored to the crowne and scepter of France, so that more
            cleere than the sunne it openlie appeareth, that the title of king Pepin, the claime of
            Hugh Capet, the possession of Lewes, yea and the French kings to this daie, are deriued
            and conueied from the heire female, though they would vnder the colour of such a fained
            law, barre the kings and princes of this realme of England of their right and lawfull
            inheritance.</quote>

         appear in <hi rend="simple:italic">OED</hi>, but following the model of <hi rend="simple:italic">impaint</hi>, <hi rend="simple:italic">impawn</hi>, etc., it
         would be a perfectly logical Shakespearean coinage, meaning "to make bare." But laying bare
         their "crooked titles" would reveal their illegitimacy, implicitly embarring them, so if a
         double meaning is implied, both have the same effect. Other suggested emendations are less
         satisfactory and harder to justify.</note>

               <gloss>The eldest of Edward III's seven sons, Edward (1330-76) was popularly known as

         victory at Cr√©cy.</gloss>
               <note type="level-2">In this play, Shakespeare strategically and selectively avoids reference to the
         dynastic conflicts that underlay the Wars of the Roses, the subject of his first
         "tetralogy" of English history plays (<hi rend="simple:italic">1H6</hi>, <hi rend="simple:italic">2H6</hi>, <hi rend="simple:italic">3H6</hi>, and <hi rend="simple:italic">R3</hi>).
         The Black Prince's son, Richard II, was deposed by Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV, an
         act that would lead to the civil wars. In the current play, Henry V is aware of the divine
         disapproval of his father's usurpation of Richard's throne (see <ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-2144">TLN 2144-46</ref>), but Canterbury's public linkage of Henry V
         to his great-uncle's glory downplays the conflict.</note>

               <note type="level-2">From 1295 to 1560, France and Scotland made a series of treaties, the "Auld
         Alliance," providing mutual military aid in conflicts with England. In 1346, during Edward
         III's campaign in France, the Scottish King David II invaded England, though as Canterbury
         notes below, he did so unsuccessfully. Hall (fol. 39), though not Holinshed, has
         Westmorland, as warden of the Scottish marches, make a similar argument:<cit>
                     <quote>None of
            your progenitors euer passed the sea in iust quarell against the Fre[n]che nacion, but
            the Scottishe people in their absence entered your realme, spoyled your houses, slewe
            your people and toke great praies innumerable, only to prouoke your auncestors for to
            returne fro[m] the inuayding of Frau[n]ce."</quote>
                  </cit> The English fears were well
         grounded in this instance; the Scottish Earl of Douglas had made arrangements in 1413 with
         the nominally pro-English Duke of Burgundy to provide each other military aid. See Anne

               <note type="level-2">Many editors since Warburton have assigned this speech to Westmorland, arguing
         that Holinshed's account of this council has Westmorland making this argument (see
         third-level note). Assigning this reasonable caveat about Scotland to the bishop, however,
         makes the character more than Canterbury's yes-man, and it adds nuance to the clergy's case
         for the war. Holinshed (546) suggests that Westmorland had a personal agenda for making
         this argument: <cit>
                     <quote>When the archbishop had ended his prepared tale, Rafe Neuill
            earle of Westmerland, and as then lord Warden of the marches against Scotland,
            understanding that the king vpon a courageous desire to recouer his right in France,
            would suerlie take the wars in hand, thought good to mooue the king to begin first with
            Scotland, and thereupon declared how easie a matter it should be to make a conquest
            there, and how greatlie the same should further his wished purpose for the subduing of
            the Frenchmen, concluding the summe of his tale with this old saieng: that <hi rend="simple:italic">Who so
               will France win, must with Scotland first begin</hi>. Manie matters he touched, as
            well to shew how necessarie the conquest of Scotland should be, as also to prooue how
            iust a cause the king had to attempt it, trusting to persuade the king and all other to
            be of his opinion.</quote>

               <note type="level-2">See Tilley (F663), which lists Hall's chronicle as the earliest instance of the
         proverb. In Holinshed (546), both versions of the proverb are cited, first by Westmorland
         and then inverted by Exeter, who <cit>
                     <quote>replied against the erle of Westmerlands
            oration, affirming rather that he which would Scotland win, he with France must first
            begin. For if the king might once compasse the conquest of France, Scotland could not
            long resist; so that conquere France, and Scotland would soone obeie. For where should
            the Scots lerne policie and skill to defend themselves, if they had not their bringing
            vp and training in France? If the French pensions mainteined not the Scotish nobilitie,
            in what case should they be? Then take awaie France, and the Scots will soone be tamed;
            France being to Scotland the same that the sap is to the tree, which being taken awaie,
            the tree must needs die and wither.</quote>

               <note type="level-2">The term has a more specific sense than "city-dwellers"; "citizen," in
         Shakespeare's London, signified a member of a recognized trade guild, especially the twelve
         great "livery companies" from which the city's governors were elected. In the absence of
         banks in early modern England, wealthy citizen merchants and their guilds were storehouses
         of liquid wealth, providing loans of ready money to individuals, to civic institutions, and
         to the crown. Canterbury's characterization of those bees who store the hive's own liquid
         wealth as "citizens" would thus have seemed particularly apt to the play's original
         audience.</note>

         the French King's eldest son. In productions, the original spelling of the title
         ("Dolphin") has suggested a fertile joke to directors. In Adrian Noble's 1984 production,
         for example, Exeter (Brian Blessed) insisted on the English pronunciation in order to irk
         the French, and the dauphin's reaction, an indignantly precise French pronunciation ("For
         the -- <hi rend="simple:italic">Doe-fan</hi>, I stand here for him") raised a laugh. Similarly, in 2000, Edward
         Hall's English characters used the Folio spellings of Dauphin, Calais ("Callice"), etc., as
         a running joke about the parochialism of the English tourist's refusal to acknowledge local

               <note type="level-2">Shakespeare alters the chronology of the political wrangling that led up to
         Henry's invasion. In Holinshed, the tennis ball embassy precedes and more clearly
         instigates the build-up to war (see <ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-408">TLN
            408</ref> n.). Only after that insult does Canterbury's speech incite the English
         lords to support the campaign, and after another French embassy Exeter is sent to France to
         demand that the French king "deliuer vnto the king of England the realme and crowne of
         France, with the entier duchies of Aquiteine, Normandie and Aniou, with the countries of
         Poictiou and Maine" and to suggest that Henry "take in mariage the ladie Katharine,
         daughter to the French king, and to indow hir with all the duchies and countries before
         rehearsed (Holinshed 546). Shakespeare's alterations to the source -- making the English
         more clearly into instigators, changing the idea of the royal marriage into a desperate
         French attempt to avoid war that "likes [Henry] not" (<ref target="text:iseH5_FM#tln-1076">TLN 1076</ref>), and removing Exeter's embassy until the English
         invasion has already begun -- might be seen cumulatively to portray the English cause less
         as a righteous response to injury, as in Holinshed, and more as a premeditated campaign
         looking for a pretext.</note>
