               <note type="level-2">The play's first scene is continuous in Plutarch with its second, both occurring on the "feast of Lupercalia" (522), 15 February 44 BC, though Shakespeare has conflated the religious festival with Caesar's triumph which occurred the previous October. The arresting opening scene, with its powerful confrontation between tribunes and people and its background suggestion of one strong man replacing another, was prompted by just two sentences in North's Plutarch, which Shakespeare brilliantly expanded: <cit>
                     <quote>"After that, there were set up images of Caesar in the city with diadems upon their heads, like kings. Those, the two tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went and pulled down: and furthermore, meeting with them that first saluted Caesar as king, they committed them to prison"</quote>
                  </cit> (522).</note>

               <term>Murellus,</term>
               <note type="level-2">In the Roman constitution a tribune was officially supposed to represent the plebeians. The fact that these two tribunes angrily confront the commoners who are their designated constituency is an indication of profound political confusion, as well as of Caesar's successful courtship of "the people," in North's phrase, though Caesar was himself a patrician. On Murellus's name, see the notes to Characters in the Play.</note>

               <note type="level-2">In the sixteenth century the word was still closely related, in both etymology and usage to "holy day" (<hi rend="simple:italic">OED</hi>), which is the spelling used twice in F (<ref target="text:iseJC_F1#tln-36">TLN 36-7</ref>, <ref target="text:iseJC_F1#tln-56">56</ref>). Regardless of the spelling, Shakespeare's use of the word immediately conflates late sixteenth-century London with late republican Rome--a frequent occurrence in the language of the play. For more detailed comments, see Richard Wilson, Arden 3, 19; Shapiro, 103, 127-35, 138-70, 173.</note>

               <note type="level-2">In North's translation of Plutarch's account, Cassius refers to "cobblers, tapsters, or suchlike base mechanical people" (821) in his attempt to win Brutus to the conspiracy. "Mechanical" and "mechanic" are usually used by patricians and aristocrats in Shakespeare (cf. <hi rend="simple:italic">2 Henry VI</hi>, 1.3.193-94, for a closely parallel example), so a tribune's use of it in the play's opening lines is especially striking.</note>

Together, these short lines emphasize Murellus's authoritarianism--his quickness to order subordinates about and his simultaneous anxiety concerning the wishes of those more powerful than he.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Six years older than Caesar, Pompey enjoyed early military success in ridding the Mediterranean of pirates and subduing the East (Syria and Judaea) for Rome. Caesar negotiated a three-way agreement between Pompey, Crassus, and himself in 60, including Pompey's marriage to Caesar's daughter Julia (Pompey's third marriage). Julia died in 54 and Crassus a year later, increasing rivalry and tension between Caesar and Pompey that eventually issued in open warfare and Pompey's defeat. Plutarch accords Pompey a biography in his <hi rend="simple:italic">Lives</hi>, and aside from <hi rend="simple:italic">Julius Caesar</hi> itself Shakespeare alludes to Pompey about four times as often as to Caesar.</note>

               <note type="level-2">In Plutarch's account the events of this scene are continuous with the previous scene, and Shakespeare seems to have intended the same continuity (the scene numbering was added by Capell in the late eighteenth century). Both scenes feature Caesar's triumph in October of 45 BC and conflate it with the feast of Lupercalia, 15 February 44, when Antony offered Caesar a diadem, just a month before his assassination. The festival was a fertility ritual, including two young men called <hi rend="simple:italic">luperci</hi>, who ran around the Palatine, naked except for a goatskin waistpiece, striking bystanders with strips of goatskin (cf. <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-91">TLN 91-97</ref>). Shakespeare would not have known that the ancient Roman festival was eventually replaced by the feast of the Purification of the Virgin in 494 AD.</note>

(He aimed to be treated as a divinity even more than he sought absolute power.) Yet the reason for the occasion has just been doubted by Flavius and Murellus, who now bring up the rear of Caesar's procession, and Caesar's grandeur is further qualified by Calpurnia's barrenness (which could as easily be Caesar's responsibility as hers), by the soothsayer's ominous prediction, and by Cassius's eventual echoes of Flavius's earlier complaints about Caesar together with compelling revelations of his vulnerability.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Following Plutarch, Shakespeare makes the friendship between Cassius and Brutus ambivalent, with ineradicable undertones of rivalry, noted by Dowden: "While Cassius thus plays with Brutus and secures him, almost using him as his tool, he is fully conscious of the superiority of Brutus" (291). Plutarch remarks that "Cassius . . .  was Brutus's familiar friend, but not so well given and conditioned as he" (813), and notes that the two had contended for a praetorship, with Caesar favoring Brutus (cf. <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-420">TLN 420</ref>), "therefore they strove one against the other" (818). It is clear by the end of this scene that Cassius's affirmation of friendship is itself a gambit in his attempt to persuade Brutus to join the conspiracy (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-415">TLN 415-429</ref>).</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus's struggle to control his passions is a major part of the way Shakespeare imagines him. As a stoic, Brutus believes passions should be controlled because they are the only controllable part of the human situation, which is otherwise determined by inexorable destiny. To be vexed with passions is therefore a detriment (<hi rend="simple:italic">soil</hi>) to his behavior (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-134">TLN 134</ref>). Shakespeare makes the inadequacy of these beliefs evident in both Brutus and Caesar.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Self-division is a necessary precondition for self-deception, but recognizing that one is divided against oneself is not necessarily equivalent to self-knowledge. For Shakespeare, division of the self was one of the oldest dramatic devices for imagining moral conflict, since it was familiar from personification allegory in the morality plays, where self-deception is also imagined in moral terms, as it is in John Davies' contemporaneous <hi rend="simple:italic">Nosce Teipsum</hi> (1599). See Cox, <hi rend="simple:italic">Seeming Knowledge</hi>, 11-14. Cassius is no Vice, but his conversation with Brutus follows the contours of the Vice's temptation, which explains the similarities between this scene and Iago's conversations with Othello. The conflict Brutus refers to is between his admiration for and gratitude to Caesar and his concern about Caesar's bid for absolute power in the republic.</note>

It also evokes, however fleetingly, Virgil's overarching sense of Roman destiny, for which everyone in Shakespeare's play is laboring, though no one is aware of it.</note>

In alchemy "noble" metals, such as gold and silver, were thought to be incapable of debasement (being "wrought") into lesser metals, but Cassius has just proved that Brutus's mettle is capable of change, and Cassius clearly delights in the fact. His satisfied comments on what he has accomplished anticipate Iago's comments about his influence on Othello, because Shakespeare drew on Vice tradition in creating both Cassius and Iago.

               <note type="level-2">Cassius attributes theatrical motives to Casca, in contrast to the transparent correspondence between inner being and outer actions in a true Roman. For Cassius to make this contrast is another instance of self-deception, because he controls his anger and impetuosity as little as Casca controls his fear. On the ambiguity of stoic constancy and theatricality, see Miles, 31-37, 42-43, 50-53, 55-57.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Given his Epicureanism, it is not clear that Cassius believes in portents and prodigies; rather, he seems to be adapting his rhetoric to his present audience, as he did earlier with Brutus, when he affirmed stoic commonplaces. Granting the marvels Casca has just described, Cassius says he knows <hi rend="simple:italic">the true cause</hi> (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-501">TLN 501</ref>) why they are appearing (implying that it is Caesar's overweening ambition). Shakespeare leaves plenty of room for inferring that Cassius's judgment is shortsighted, if the real reason for the prodigies is the conspiracy against Caesar, but the play also leaves open the possibility that Cicero is right in thinking that there are no marvels to begin with (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-465">TLN 465-467</ref>), though Cicero's judgment is also called into question by his last line (see TLN 468n.). The main verb of Cassius's long sentence is <hi rend="simple:italic">change</hi> (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-505">TLN 505</ref>), and it includes <hi rend="simple:italic">calculate</hi> (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-504">TLN 504</ref>), which is strictly ungrammatical but not incomprehensible and may convey Cassius's impetuous mood more effectively (Oxford 1, 122n.)</note>

               <note type="level-2">Despite his self-professed Epicureanism (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2416">TLN 2416</ref>), Cassius here expresses a stoic commonplace that death was a release from the necessity imposed by events on the living. Cf. Montaigne's essay, "That to philosophize is to learn to die," which begins by citing Cicero as the authority for the saying in the title. Strato later cites the same commonplace in relation to Brutus's suicide (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2703">TLN 2703</ref>). At this point, Cassius appears to be using the idea and his elaboration on it as a stalking horse for his investigation of Casca's political inclinations.</note>

               <note type="level-2">The setting is based on a sentence in Plutarch, contrasting Brutus's public calm with his private agitation: "But when night came that he was in his own house, then he was clean changed" (823). No indication of the garden occurs in the dialogue, but it is clearly a private space, open to the same night sky as in the previous scene, and immediately adjacent to Brutus's house. The stage direction has been taken as evidence that the Folio copy was authorial, because <hi rend="simple:italic">orchard</hi> is atmospheric rather than functional in the theater. Whoever wrote the stage direction, the setting can be consistently imagined as the urban garden of a wealthy landowner in the Elizabethan manner, enclosed with a wall and attached to the back of the house. For illustrations and discussion, see Picard, 68-83, and for other examples of the stage direction, see Dessen and Thomson, 99.</note>

The contrast emphasizes Brutus's conflicted spirit, despite his assertions of self-mastery, and his tenderness for Lucius indicates a depth of feeling that Brutus tries vainly, as a conscientious stoic, to suppress. There may also be something oddly self-regarding for Brutus in the boy's name, which echoes the name of Brutus's famed ancestor.</note>

He has made up his mind, so the rationale for his decision seems designed to suppress lingering doubts rather than to arrive at a conclusion. Dover Wilson compares the monosyllabic opening with similar openings in soliloquies from other plays (Cambridge 1, 124n.).<lb/>
                  <lb/>Coleridge was genuinely puzzled by these lines: "surely, nothing can seem more discordant with our historical preconception of Brutus, or more lowering to the intellect of the Stoico-Platonic tyrannicide, than the tenets here ascribed to him" (Bate, ed., <hi rend="simple:italic">Romantics</hi>, 376). Brutus's soliloquy anticipates Hamlet's many troubled meditations. Having been strongly influenced by Cassius, Brutus now thinks through his reasons for the assassination. They are not very good reasons, but they indicate his stoic tendency to generalize abstractly, as if ideas and the mind could function perfectly without regard to the body. His idealism contrasts with Cassius's cynicism (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-415">TLN 415-422</ref>), but Brutus has listened to Cassius, and Brutus's reasoning betrays a notable lack of self-knowledge.</note>

               <note type="level-2">One of the most consistent themes in Plutarch's life of Caesar is Caesar's calculating courtship of "the people," in North's translation.

Shakespeare's Antony is a master of the same populist strategy on the part of a patrician, and it is perfected by English noblemen, namely Henry Bolingbroke and his son, in earlier plays.

The Folio's "first" is not necessarily wrong, however. Julius Caesar had reformed the calendar in the very year he died, and his calendar had in turn required reform in Shakespeare's lifetime (1582), causing much confusion in Protestant England, which refused to adopt the reform because it was instituted by Pope Gregory XIII. The perplexity caused particular controversy in mid-1599 (Sohmer, 17-24), so Brutus's mistake could be a deliberate reflection of Elizabethan calendrical uncertainty imagined for ancient Rome in the first century BC.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus's apostrophe to conspiracy emphasizes his ambivalence. He is committed to the assassination for what he believes are noble reasons, yet he has just condemned himself for joining it, and he now condemns the conspiracy itself, though he remains faithful to it. Plutarch remarks that Brutus himself "did so frame and fashion his countenance and looks, that no man could discern he had anything to trouble his mind" (823), but the terms Shakespeare gives him in this speech--especially the allusion to hell in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-709">TLN 709--</ref>are deeply indebted to medieval drama and to the Vice in particular, who was famous for duplicity and hypocrisy.

Jowett points out that "patth" ("an attested 16<hi rend="simple:sup">th</hi>-c. spelling") looks similar to "putte" in secretary hand, so the compositor might have confused the first for the second(<hi rend="simple:italic">Textual Companion</hi>, 388); besides, "put" follows naturally from the metaphor of disguise rather than introducing a new and unrelated metaphor with "path."</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus immediately contradicts Cassius, again indicating the tension between them, and he then proceeds to offer reasons for his view that not only are bad in themselves but also turn out to be mistaken in the long run. Brutus's analogy of Caesar and Antony to head and limbs is ingenious but misleading, like his appeal to a natural analogy in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-630">TLN 630-631</ref>. The assassination is bound to be bloody, no matter how Brutus may try to disguise the fact, so the analogy is another example of Brutus's trying to hide the truth from himself, as well as from others.</note>

               <note type="level-2">This scene occurs just before the midpoint, literally making the rest of the play anti-climactic, though Shakespeare relaxes none of the tension, and by placing the assassination so early he emphasizes the play's "undular" structure (Velz). From three domestic scenes (two at Brutus's house and one at Caesar's), full of quiet, furtive, and anxious dialogue, the action suddenly becomes public, ceremonial, and crowded. Caesar walks from an imagined street where the Soothsayer accosts him to an imagined Capitol, but on the Globe stage both locations would have been the same, distinguished only by Caesar's movement and probably by his seating himself in a chair of state (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1240">TLN 1240</ref>). A statue of Pompey also seems to be required near the place where Caesar falls (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1330">TLN 1330</ref>, <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1725">1725</ref>). Spevack supplies a possible illustration of the original staging, drawn by C. Walter Hodges (Cambridge 2, 4), though it omits the memorial to Pompey, which could have been made of light lath and plaster so that it could be easily moved on and off the stage.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Shakespeare's invention of Caesar's reply is ironic in several ways. Caesar's magnanimity in refusing publicly to attend to what serves his personal interest is a rhetorical pose (evident in the self-important royal "we" and the quick-witted wordplay at Artemidorus's expense) that contrasts with everything else in his life. His pose nonetheless turns Artemidorus's well-meant plea against the pleader, with the consequence that Caesar fails to heed yet another warning.</note>

His suppression of feeling, evident in everything he does, is here manifested in a complete divorce of feeling from action--a divorce that precisely anticipates political violence in the name of reason in later eras. The disjunction in Brutus's thinking is so complete that Pope assigned <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1320">TLN 1320-1325</ref> to Cassius, instead of Brutus, on the grounds that they were inappropriate to Brutus's grave and philosophical character.</note>

Though Brutus has just greeted him, Antony boldly ignores the conspirators entirely and addresses his attention wholly to the dead Caesar, still lying in his gore.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Antony's second thought provides a means (and an implicit stage direction) for two actors to remove Caesar's body in a dignified fashion, but dramatically the way Antony frames the request is a reminder of how Antony outflanked Brutus and a notice to Octavius that Antony is a force to be reckoned with. Plutarch makes Antony less calculating than Shakespeare does but no less ambitious and competitive: "But now, the opinion he conceived of himself after he had a little felt the goodwill of the people towards him, hoping thereby to make himself the chiefest man if he might overcome Brutus, did easily make him alter his first mind" (689).</note>

               <note type="level-2">Much has been made of an apparent discrepancy between this stage direction and the implicit stage direction in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1541">TLN 1541</ref>, which seems to suggest that Brutus does not ascend into <hi rend="simple:italic">the pulpit</hi> until ten lines into the scene. <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1528">TLN 1528</ref> may indicate a delayed action, or the reference in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1541">TLN 1541</ref> may have been included to allow the actor time to exit the main stage, ascend to the gallery through the tiring house, and emerge "above" for his oration. Shakespeare's reference to a "pulpit" was almost certainly remembered from Plutarch, who refers variously to "the pulpit" (828) and the chair or pulpit for orations"(836), using <hi rend="simple:italic">chair</hi> in an archaic sense to mean <hi rend="simple:italic">pulpit</hi> (<hi rend="simple:italic">OED</hi> chair <hi rend="simple:italic">n</hi>.1 5, earliest citation from 1648). Daniell observes that "the second half of the play begins with a strong echo of the first. Two men in authority encounter an unruly crowd" (Arden 3, 252n.). Plutarch says "they were a multitude of rakehells of all sorts, and had a goodwill to make some stir" (828), but Dover Wilson notes that these <hi rend="simple:italic">Plebeians</hi> show the same "combination of familiarity and deference" as the <hi rend="simple:italic">commoners</hi> do in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2">TLN 2</ref> (Cambridge 1, 161n.).</note>

               <note type="level-2">One of Shakespeare's most remarkable accomplishments in <hi rend="simple:italic">Julius Caesar</hi> was his composing of Brutus's and Antony's speeches. Plutarch reports that Brutus spoke twice, once in the Capitol and again in the market-place (828-29). The only hint he gives of Brutus's style is that "he counterfeited that brief compendious manner of speech of the Lacedaemonians" (814), which accounts for the laconic prose that Shakespeare gives him, designed to offer the facts in a reasonable manner with minimal rhetorical embellishment.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus begs an important question, since the replacement of the republic with a monarchy would not automatically change the status of all free men to slaves, as Shakespeare and his audience well knew. They lived in a monarchy, and all Londoners (even apprentices) were "freemen," the opposite of "serfs." Brutus begs the same question again in the first of his climactic rhetorical questions (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1558">TLN 1558-1559</ref>).</note>

               <gloss>From frenzied noisy plebeian mob violence in a public place we move to cool decisions for judicial murder among select patricians in a quiet setting, but the result is the same in both cases: people die. Plutarch comments on the patricians' deliberations: "In my opinion there was never a more horrible, unnatural, and crueller change than this was." The scene also sketches in relations among the triumvirs, who are trying to assert control of the republic (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1868">TLN 1868</ref>).</gloss>

               <gloss>This scene and the succeeding one are continuous except for an imagined change of location from outside Brutus's tent to inside it.</gloss>
               <note type="level-2">See <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1967">TLN 1967</ref>. The unacknowledged competitive friction between Antony and Octavius in the previous scene is immediately followed by open and nearly violent conflict between Brutus and Cassius, who have been in an uneasy contest with each other from the beginning of their alliance against Caesar. The succession of scenes suggests that Brutus and Cassius have reached a later stage in their rivalry than the other two, as later scenes and <hi rend="simple:italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi> bear out. The quarrel and reconciliation of Brutus and Cassius was one of the most admired episodes in <hi rend="simple:italic">Julius Caesar</hi> in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, because it was thought to display such nobility of spirit on Brutus's part. Brutus is undoubtedly noble, as Plutarch emphasizes (838), but one of his most salient qualities as a patrician is prideful self-ignorance, which appears here in his aggressive display of anger management, which he uses to maintain his dominance over Cassius. Brutus and Cassius have left Rome, as noted in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1810">TLN 1810</ref>, and they are making camp with their armies near Sardis (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1940">TLN 1940</ref>), capital of Lydia, now part of Turkey. Contention for control of the republic has taken the contenders far from Rome, where the republic originated, and the play will end without returning to Rome and with the contention unresolved.</note>

On the fluid Globe stage this change would not have been marked, especially since Brutus and Cassius do not exit, but Pope's printing innovation is now almost 300 years old, and clarity of reference recommends it, since almost all editions follow it. Brutus has posted guards outside his tent entrance (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1968">TLN 1968</ref>), where they intercept the interruptive poet (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2108">TLN 2108</ref>).</gloss>

Brutus has said he would listen to Cassius's <hi rend="simple:italic">griefs</hi>, and Cassius falls into Brutus's plan by voicing his anger at once, thus forgetting to mention Brutus's principal weakness (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1954">TLN 1954</ref>) and giving Brutus a chance to practice his aggressive self-control on him.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus uses his idealism about the assassination to assault Cassius for Cassius's reputed corruption, but Brutus thereby suppresses the ambiguities of the conspiracy (acknowledged to himself briefly in a moment of rare candor [<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-702">TLN 702-710</ref>]) and prevents himself from recognizing the irony that he is again competing in deadly earnest with a rival patrician, as he had competed with Caesar. No conspirator had mentioned Caesar's favoring "all them that did rob and spoil, by his countenance and authority" (Plutarch, 844) when they were planning the assassination, and Brutus's assertion now that <hi rend="simple:italic">justice</hi> was the motive amounts to special pleading to make his case for the parallel between Cassius and Caesar.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus returns to a mode of competitive speech he had employed when disagreeing with Cassius before the assassination. Without openly accusing Cassius of being un-Roman, Brutus had listed contrasting qualities of those (like Cassius) who want to take oaths as opposed to true Romans (like himself) who do not (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-763">TLN 763-771</ref>), and he had implicitly compared anyone who wanted to assassinate Antony along with Caesar to a dog (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-807">TLN 807</ref>). Brutus's rejection of dogs now as un-Roman recalls that earlier disagreement and comprises his second implicit comparison of Cassius to an animal in their current dispute (cf. <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-1934">TLN 1934-1939</ref> and note).</note>

Finding himself at a disadvantage with Cassius, because Cassius has raised more money, Brutus blames Cassius for raising the money dishonestly (betraying Rome and the patrician class in the process) and thereby shames Cassius into sharing it. (Plutarch says that "Cassius gave him the third part of his total sum" [840].) In bald terms, Brutus is practicing a form of moral blackmail.</note>

               <note type="level-2">This is Shakespeare's clearest reference to Brutus's stoicism. (See Miles, 125-27.) Plutarch remarks that of all the Greek philosophers, Brutus "loved Plato's sect best" (814), but the stoics drew heavily on Plato's descriptions of Socrates's amazing self-control. They argued that one can do nothing to change events, which happen according to destiny, so one needs to control feelings, desires, and wishes in response to events, as Socrates does when anticipating his own death in the <hi rend="simple:italic">Phaedo</hi>. Cassius's phrase, <hi rend="simple:italic">accidental evils</hi> is facetious, since nothing was accidental for stoics. Having been thoroughly beaten in his war of words and wits with Brutus, Cassius makes this mild jibe as an attempted come-back in response to Brutus's unexpected acknowledgment of <hi rend="simple:italic">many griefs</hi> (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2131">TLN 2131</ref>).</note>

               <term>No man . . . dead.</term>
               <note type="level-2">This is a shocking revelation, as Cassius's response indicates, but it is not completely straightforward. Brutus's first statement flatly contradicts Cassius's jibe in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2132">TLN 2132-2133</ref>, indicating that it has indeed registered with Brutus. In effect, then, his news about Portia's death is a definitive way to put Cassius down--both to deny that Brutus is untrue to his principles and to reject Cassius's awkwardly jocular attempt to impugn him. Whereas Brutus had earlier used moral blackmail to dominate Cassius (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2046">TLN 2046-2052</ref>), he now uses emotional blackmail. At the same time, Brutus's struggle with his stoic principles is evident in all he says about Portia's death, and the struggle makes him more sympathetic, because it makes him less coldly resistant to suffering. To be absolutely true to stoic ethics, he would have said nothing at all about his wife's suicide, but by saying nothing he would have sacrificed the validation of his self-control in Cassius's response to it.</note>

First, it is the opposite of the stoic ideal, by which one opposes necessity (fate) by defying the natural urges of body, will, and desire, thereby making reason (or conformity with fate) one's nature instead. (Socrates's ability to go without sleep for unimaginably long periods of time is remembered and praised by Alcibiades in <hi rend="simple:italic">The Symposium</hi>.) Second, Brutus is not able to sleep, suggesting that he has overridden his natural need for it by unnatural deeds (such as the assassination) that he justified with specious reasoning in defiance of true feeling (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-628">TLN 628-650</ref>). Shakespeare will return to Brutus's kind of sleeplessness again unforgettably in <hi rend="simple:italic">Macbeth</hi>.</note>

The murder was highly principled, in Brutus's own view, while his treatment of Lucius compromises the stoic principle that one should follow nature by maintaining complete indifference to everything. Nature, Montaigne says, taught Thales "that life and death were matters of indifference; wherefore, to the man who asked him why then he did not die, he replied very wisely: 'Because it is indifferent'" (<hi rend="simple:italic">Essays</hi>, 67).</note>

               <gloss>The approach of Antony and Octavius has been anticipated in <ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2162">TLN 2162-2164</ref>, and the last act begins with their arrival <hi rend="simple:italic">at Philippi</hi> (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2333">TLN 2333</ref>) to confront the combined forces of Brutus and Cassius. From the moment we see Antony and Octavius together for the second time, they are competing constantly with each other--a development Shakespeare has anticipated earlier in this play and will bring to fruition in <hi rend="simple:italic">Antony and Cleopatra</hi>. The first half climaxed in a violent and bloody assassination, which brought nothing to a conclusion, least of all the fierce competition for personal dominance that Caesar personified, and the second half climaxes in the violence of battle, which is also inconclusive. Though the battle at Philippi at least presents the two sides as evenly matched, it goes against the chief conspirators, so Caesar's supplanters are supplanted, and Caesar's spirit implicitly triumphs, as the play comes to a sudden stop.</gloss>

Judging from Leonard Digges's praise of "<hi rend="simple:italic">half-Sword parlying</hi> Romans" in Digges's commendatory verses for the First Folio, early productions of Shakespeare's Roman plays used historically correct Roman short swords, rather than the modern rapiers Shakespeare refers to anachronistically elsewhere--in the English history plays, for example. (On the introduction of the rapier into England in the mid-sixteenth century, see Stone, 242-50.) Digges refers to "half-sword parley" again in his verses for the Third Folio (1663-64). Henry Peacham's illustration of <hi rend="simple:italic">Titus Andronicus</hi>, on the other hand, shows the actors (whether correctly or not) with rapiers.</note>

Brutus describes Cassius idealistically as a defender of the republic against tyranny. Using rhetoric appropriate to mourning, his comments gloss over the tension between the conspirators.</note>

               <note type="level-2">Brutus has just announced a "second fight" (<ref target="text:iseJC_M#tln-2600">TLN 2600</ref>), which commences at once. This is, in effect, the second battle of Philippi that Plutarch says took place twenty days after the first (856). Plutarch notes that Brutus's deeds in the first battle "showed that he hoped not in vain to be conqueror" (853), and that a subsequent sea battle also ended victoriously for Brutus's navy, though the news failed to reach him in time to prevent the second land battle, without which Brutus would likely have emerged victorious simply by waiting, because Antony and Octavius were in desperate shape (856). Shakespeare's streamlining and compression of events at the end of the play produces a stronger sense of inevitable defeat for Brutus than in Plutarch's narrative.</note>
